# NeurIPS_2020_Snake

We have now added a Jupyter notebook file for studying the extrapolation and interpolation properties of neural networks. See 'extrapolation_experiments.ipynb'.
In the notebook, a very elementary implementation of the Snake activation function is given.

# Done
- Extrapolation experiments and simple implementation of Snake.

# TODO
- Regression task on market index
- Temperature regression task
- more advanced implementations of Snake (such as learnable a)


# Notes
We are on our way cleaning our code! It should be ready within a week or two. We will let you know once we make an update.

In the mean-while, let me comment that Edward Dixon had made an implementation of our method a while ago. It can be found here:
